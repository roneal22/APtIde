First, use postman.com to try out your API.  Add a screen shot to your submission doc so that we 
know you completed this tas.
Then, use the AJAX data pattern we learned to send a request to the API, retrieve some data and 
display the data. 
See the Reading page for ideas for public API’s.
Requirements:
